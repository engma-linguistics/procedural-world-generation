# State

**Last updated: 2026-10-24.** Overwrite this page; never append (history is in git). Refresh the counts with `uv run python issue-tracking/board.py milestones`.

## Lanes running
<!-- coordinator: fill in at each compaction or lane change -->
- Physics (Opus): PW-806 plant pCO2/warming responses (v1 blocker: star-warmed L7 Earth-likes are treeless). PW-780 sign-off page written, owner question open. PW-798 WIP parked on branch hold/pw798-ref-freeze until after v1.0.
- Fun (Sonnet): idle (showcase build). Merged PW-797 salt miners (miner trait reads beds/ore; PW-804/805 follow-ups); PW-793 (no fiend dairy) and PW-794 (horse contact uptake, barriers) merged; riders test now reads "home" as every landmass the horse reached (both strict conditions kept). Next: PW-797 salt-miner dwarves, PW-800 follow-ups.
- Pick planet for seven_meals: 6fbc2c (peoples run 104de8, may be replaced by fun lane 22).

## v1
- Epic PW-244. Only the owner sign-off PW-780 is open (default `star_brightening` 0.45, a K-type star; provisional owner OK 2026-10-24). 2 open tickets in the v1 milestone.
- Strict icehouse bar: L6 13/18 seed-draws, L7 7/8. Rule: ~70% pass, never-ice and always-icebox both fail ([glossary](glossary.md), [decisions](decisions.md)).
- Showcase remake (PW-202) done; the 4 L6 + 4 L7 showcases below.

## v2 and later (board.py milestones, 2026-10-24)
| milestone | open | done |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | 2 | 104 |
| v2 | 162 | 115 |
| v3 | 17 | 2 |
| later | 72 | 2 |
| unscheduled | 44 | 274 |

v2 priorities: always one fun lane on peoples/lineages (PW-692 frames the end goal), then speed, resources (PW-155), zoom quality (PW-516). Roadmap: [plan_next.md](../plan_next.md).

- Unmerged branches or held work: ask `git branch --no-merged main` and the lane tickets; not tracked here.
