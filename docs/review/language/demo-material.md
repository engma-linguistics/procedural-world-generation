# Demo material: run a24559, final languages.json (2026-11-04)

Extracted from `runs/a24559/languages.json` (132 MB; 1,249 lects, 633 living, 600 languages, 260 true families, 214 shifts,
98 food routes, 6/6 checks pass, human horizon 9.0 kyr). Every number was computed from the file; the scripts are in the session
scratchpad, not the repo. IPA in plain text, book spelling in ‹›. Tags in cognate tables: `=` inherited from the family's proto;
`N` a root coined inside the family; `L` a loan from outside the family; `+d` derived or compounded on the way; `~` a meaning shift
on the way.

### INVENTORIES

**PHOIBLE reference** (`phoible_inventory_sizes.tsv`, 2,175 inventories): consonants median 21 (IQR 17-27), vowels median 9
(IQR 6-12), tones median 0 (IQR 0-0).

| proto | speakers | C | consonants | V | vowels | tones, syllables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| p306 | human | 26 | p b ɓ f v m t d tʰ ts dz s z ʃ tʃ n r l ȶ ʈ j k ɡ ŋ w h | 10 | i e ɛ a ɔ o u ɨ aː ɔː | 5 tones; up to CCVC; stress penult |
| p255 | kobold | 21 | β tʰ d ts s n l ɻ tʃ dʒ j k kʰ ɡ x ɣ ŋ χ ʔ h hʲ | 10 | i iː e̞ ẽ̞ ə a aː ɑ o̞ u | no tone; up to CCVC |

All three sit inside PHOIBLE's consonant IQR; the human and kobold vowel counts are at the upper end, the aarakocra one at the
lower. **Avian labials are scarce, as ruled:** p222 has only m and b (p306 has six: p b ɓ f v m); over all protos the median is
6 labials for humans, 3 for aarakocra, 2 for kobolds and dragons. **Second-source and harsh segments are there:** p222 has a
second-voice vowel (iːᴖ) and a harsh trill (r‼); 52% of aarakocra protos carry a ᴖ segment and 57% a harsh one. They fade:
among living aarakocra lects only 23% still have ᴖ and 35% a harsh segment (kobolds fall from 72% to 45% harsh; dragons stay at
99%). Humans and elves have none, as they should.

**Living inventories by species group** (quartiles q1 / median / q3):

| group | living lects | consonants | vowels | tones |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| human | 105 | 24 / 28 / 35 | 11 / 13 / 15 | 4 / 4 / 5 |
| dragons (10 kinds) | 118 | 22 / 27 / 33 | 7 / 11 / 15 | 2 / 3 / 4 |
| elves (elf, drow, sea elf) | 27 | 15 / 24 / 34.5 | 8 / 9 / 10.5 | 3.5 / 4 / 4 |
| kobolds | 53 | 25 / 29 / 31 | 8 / 11 / 15 | 4 / 4 / 4 |
| aarakocra | 26 | 22 / 27 / 33 | 7 / 9.5 / 13 | 4 / 4 / 5 |

Protos start inside PHOIBLE's range (the check's 110 human-voiced protos: median 23 C, 8 V). After 20 kyr they have grown: **half
of all living lects are above PHOIBLE's upper quartile for consonants (51% over 27) and nearly half for vowels (46% over 12)**,
and 98% of living lects are tonal against 24% of protos (about 40% of the world's languages are tonal).

### SAMPLES

**(a) Human family p306** (proto 20 kyr; 42 living lects, many of them spoken by halflings, orcs and aarakocra after shifts). Five
human lects of the d604 branch and one of the d561 branch. Split dates: d604-d856 1.5 kyr; d604-d702 12; d604-d691 13; d604-d666
15; d774 against all the others 19.

Correspondences that can be stated. **d604 : d856** (1.5 kyr, 73 of 100 core roots shared): d604 ɜ = d856 ə (14 tokens: BREAST,
DIE, EAR, HEAD, DRINK, NIGHT ...); d604 v = d856 x or f (10: DIE, DRINK, EAR, MAN; HEAD, HEART, KILL); d604 ʒ = d856 ʃ and d604 ɦ
= d856 h (d856 devoices fricatives); d604 oral i, ə = d856 nasal ĩ, ə̃ / ɨ̃ (19 tokens); d604 word-final high-toned vowel = d856
vowel + ʔ (DOG kxaːʔi˨˦ : kxaːʔĩʔ, EYE, SEED, TREE). **From the proto:** *p and *ɡ > ʔ word-initially (WATER *pj- > ʔ in four
lects; I *ŋaɡ > ɲ̟ĩʔ); voiced stops become breathy (EYE *d > dʱ); final consonants go (*-p, *-d, *-m, *-r); *a > ɨ (ONE *ŋa > ŋɨ,
ɲɨ); *ȶ is the most stable consonant (HAND *ȶɨ unchanged in three lects after 13-19 kyr). Deeper pairs share little: d666 : d691
(13 kyr) 11 roots. **What a linguist would stop on:** a prefix lɨ˨˦- (the 'thing' derivation) has eaten the vocabulary: 12% of
all words in this family start with it, so TREE, NIGHT, STONE, FISH, TWO and THOU look alike across the family for a reason that
is not inheritance; d774 has one word for I and WE.

**(b) Dragonborn family p120** (proto 20 kyr; d148, d280, d308, d544 are first-generation daughters, d771 budded from d148 at 7.0
kyr). Kobolds would have made a weaker table: the largest kobold family (p255, 16 living lects) keeps a median 1% of its proto
core words, and 28% of living kobold lects keep none.

Correspondences: proto final stops are lost everywhere (*-t, *-k: ONE, I, DOG); the harsh vowel *i‼ becomes a plain mid vowel
(ɛ, e̞, ɪ: HAND, ONE, STONE); *ʈ is kept in every lect (I: ʈi, ʈi˦c, ʈje); *t- gives h in d148 (ONE ha-), ʔ in d280, t in d771 and
d308; d308 breaks *i after coronals into je (ʈje, tje, ɫje); *k > c in d280 (I ʈic). d148 : d771 (7 kyr) share 18 roots, with
shared new coinages TWO li˦ (d148, 14.0 kyr) and DOG qʰiː (10.5 kyr); d280 : d308 (20 kyr) share 9. **Winces:** the descendants
of a harsh, consonant-heavy proto have become vowel strings (FIRE ɹa˦i˦ɛ˨i˨ɾ, ONE ta˦a˦ɛ˦ɪ˦ʔ, DOG ʔɛ˦ɛ˨iː˨ʔɛ˦); d280 has one
word ʈi˦c for both I and WE.

**(c) Four etymologies.**

1. **SMALL in d636.1 (halfling), 15 steps, two loans.** 20 kyr blue-dragon proto p19 *kucɾɔʎzi* 'husband' > 12.0 d39 *tʃiː˦ɾɑ˦zi˨*
   > 11.0 **borrowed by humans** (d561) *ʃeːɾadze* 'husband' > 10.0 *hiɾadzi* > 9.5 HUSBAND + 'thing' = *lɨ˨˦hiɾa* 'man' > 6.5
   MAN + CHILD = 'male person', then MALE PERSON + FATHER = *lɨ˨˦ɦa˦ʈe˧ʂ* 'man' > 5.5 MAN + PEOPLE = *lɛ˨˦hɛː˨mɛ˧dʱɪ˨* 'person' >
   5.0 into orcish d652.3 by shift *lɛ˨˦ɦmɛ˧dʱː* > 4.5 PERSON + MAN = 'child' > 4.0 CHILD + 'like' = *lɛ˨˦ɦmɛ˧ʔɪ˨* 'small' > 3.0
   *lɛː˨˦mɛ˧* > 1.0 **borrowed by halflings** (d636.1 from d841) > now *lɛ˧mɛ˧* ‹lẹmẹ›. 'Child-like' for 'small' is good; the
   man > male person > man > person > child loop in 2 kyr is not.
2. **Rice, by food route** (route `crop:rice`, "tamed here" at d710, human, 9.5 kyr, *ɨ˨xɜ˦ɨ˨*; 54 hops). The chain to the triton
   lect d767: 9.0 hill giant d26 *ɨ˨ɣɜ˨ɨ˨* (lenition: x > ɣ between vowels) > 7.5 copper dragon d71 *ʔɛ˨ɛ˨ɛ˨* > 5.5 orc d677
   *ʔɛ˧ɛ˧ɛ˧* (tones levelled) > 2.0 human d604 *ʔĩ˧ɨ̃˧* > 0.5 tortle d206 *ʔɨ˨ɜ˨* (nasality lost, ɨ̃ pushed to ɜ) > 0.0 triton
   d767 *ʔɨ˨ɜ˨* ‹'ï̀ë̀›. But the triton word's own etymology says something else: orcish d677 made it at 3.0 kyr as WATER +
   'little' (*ʔĩ˦ɨ̃˦ʔɨ̃˦*, from a brass-dragon word for water borrowed at 9.5 kyr) and that word travelled d677 > d604 > d206 > d767.
   The hop table splices two different words; in 28% of all hops the receiver's word shows no borrowing at all.
3. **A substrate survivor: 'horses' in d148.1** (deme 148, dragonborn now speaking a human language; see (d)). 20 kyr proto p120
   *sret.ʃsukqʰi‼k* > by 3.5 kyr in dragonborn d148, after 39 sound changes, *ʔa˦i˦i˨a˨i˨* > 2.0 kept through the shift as substrate
   *ʔa˨i˨i˨a˨i˨* (high tones heard as low: accent) > 1.5 *ʔa˦i˨i˨a˨i˨*. 'Cattle' in the same lect is a substrate word reused:
   d148 *e̞˦i˦ʔa˦i˦ɾ* 'animal' (BIRD + OLD) > substrate *e̞˨i˨ʔa˨i˨ɾ* > 1.5 ANIMAL + GREEN = *vi˨˦ʒʔa˨i˨ɾ* 'cattle'.
4. **A compound: SMITHING in d806 (human).** 5.5 kyr d562 coins *me˦nɲi˦ɲh* 'fire' > 3.0 d806 *mɜ˦ɜ˦ɲɜ˦˨ɜ˦* > 1.0 FIRE + STRIKE,
   both clipped, *mɨː˦ʔɜ˦mɜ˦ɜ˦* 'smithing' > now *mɨ˦ʔə˦mɜ˦ɜ˦* ‹mḯ'ë́më́ë́›. Also good: DAY = SUN + SKY in d570.1 from an elvish
   'sun'; SPIRIT = GOD + BREATHE in d605 (though d605 cycles spirit > god > spirit > god > spirit five times in 18 kyr).

**(d) One shift in full: deme 148 (dragonborn 4, the west of Trojanel) to human, 2.0 kyr ago.**
- **Trigger:** humans of deme 791 took 76 dragonborn sites, a town or city among them, about 2.2 kyr ago (`takeover`, strength
  1.0, held to now; source settlements.json holders). The dragonborn stayed under human rule.
- **Shares of the rulers' lect d791 among the dragonborn:** 2.5 kyr 0.23, **2.0 kyr 0.53: shift** (another human lect, d584, 0.05).
  After the shift the old dragonborn lect keeps 0.38 (1.5 kyr), 0.31, 0.25, **0.21 now**, and d584 rises to 0.14.
- **The old lect lives on:** d148 is alive, flagged `minority`.
- **Old d148 (dragonborn):** 24 C `ʔ tʃ h ɹ ʈ ɾ l ʒ kʼ dʱ x qʰ ɫ kx ʃ ʁ ʂ c t ɦ k s ɖʱ χ`, 8 V `i i‼ ɛ e̞ e‼ a ɘ̠ e`: no labials,
  no nasals. **New d148.1:** 26 C with f pf pʷ v bv ɱ ŋ ŋʷ ɲ̟, 16 V; the rulers' d791 has 28 and 14.
- **Core words, old / new / rulers' now:** WATER ʂi˨t.si˦˨ / hi˨xi˨x / pfə˨pfə˨ɲɨ˦ʃə˨ʃ; FIRE ɹa˦i˦ɛ˨i˨ɾ / ŋi˦fi˨ʒx / ŋɨ˦pfŋi˦ɣfə˨dʱ;
  HAND ʔi˦ɛ˨ / hɨ˦ / pfɨ˦; ONE ha˦ɛ˦i˨˦ / kxi˦ / ŋɛ˦pfi˨vʃe˨; I i˦ʈi˨ / kxɨ˦ / kxɨ˦; EAT ʔi˦ɾ / ʔi˦x / ʔy˦ʃ; NIGHT qʰi˦ / ʉ˦ / ʉ˦. The
  new lect took the rulers' words of 2.0 kyr ago (WATER was *ɲɨːʒəːʒ* then) and both have moved since; I, NIGHT still match.
- **Substrate kept:** 65 concepts: landscape (HILL, MOUNTAIN, RIVER, SEA, FORD, PASS, COAST, MARSH ...), wild and farm animals
  (DEER, WOLF, BEAR, horses, cattle, goats, fowl), FISH, BIRD, DOG, LOUSE, TREE, STONE, and three crops.
- **Accent (old sound for new):** m > v, n > ɹ, nʼ > ɹ, ɲ > ʒ, pf > f, ʍ > k, d > dʱ, ð > s, ø > e, y > i, ɨ > i, ə > e, u > ɘ̠.
  Sensible for speakers with no labials and no nasals: those heard as the nearest sound they have.
- **Calques from dragonborn:** no copula (rulers have one); polar question particle moved to the start.

**(e) Two paradigms from living lects** (`paradigms` per lect: nouns and verbs with cells, segmentation, irregular cells; history
from the snapshots' `grams`).

Place names, each with its chain:
- **River Engengif, 'the long river' (deme 677, orc; P2, substrate).** Halfling d416: *ə˦˨tʃ* 'far' (coined 12.5 kyr) > *ɜ˦˨f*
  > FAR + 'like' = *ə˦ŋɨ˨ɜ˦˨f* 'long' (8.5) > *ʔɜ˦ŋɜ˨ɜ˦˨f*; *a˨˦ŋi˨˦f* 'river' (4.5) > *ŋi˨˦f*; name *ʔɜ˦ŋɜ˨ŋi˨˦f* > kept by the orcs
  when deme 416 shifted, *ʔɛ˧ŋɛ˧ŋi˧f* (tones levelled to mid).
- **Peak Kxallïï, 'the black mountain' (deme 666, human).** p306 *ze˦˨m* 'night' (20 kyr) > *si˨* > *ɨ˦* > NIGHT + 'like' = *ɨ˦ɨ̃˦˨*
  'black' (5.0) > *ɨ˦ɨ˦˨*; *ɡɣã˧l* 'mountain' (coined 7.0) > *kxa˦ɫ*; name *kxa˦ɫɨ˦ɨ˦˨*. 'Night-like' for 'black' is good.
- **Lake Neðnitiʿnishwdhix, 'the stone lake' (deme 51, brass dragon; P2).** Kobold d239: *ɣri˦˨ɕsiː˦˨x* 'stone' (coined 0.5 kyr),

  *nɛ˨ðni˨t̪i˨ʕni˨ʃʷði˨x* (13 segments). The name is dated 20 kyr, from words coined in the last 1 kyr.

### CHANGELOG

Read as a linguist: each change is a real, attested type and the sequence has natural chains (s > h > ∅; p t k > f θ x > h;
voiced stops > breathy > tone). Too much of it, though: 16 changes per kyr, the same handful recurring (h-loss six times, a > ɛ
four), and the inventory ends with ŋ͡m, ɓ̥ (a voiceless implosive) and both ɖ and ȡ, at 36 C against PHOIBLE's 21.

**d726 (aarakocra 34, the north of Sothasor; p204 > d292 > d726 (9.5)), in brief.** 389 changes (19.5 per kyr; generation 5.8
years): effort 148, coarticulation 93, dispersion 67, perception 34, tonogenesis 25, prosody 22. Only **10 adopted** (all from
d180): aarakocra change on their own. 71 rules repeat (merges 21, s > h 7, h-loss 7). The first step (19.5) alone has 27 changes;
at 10.0 and again at 1.0 the lect applies n > ŋ and ŋ > n finally in the same step; at 5.0 t > θ and θ > t. Inventory: 20 kyr

**Horizon: share of true splits the scholars' tree recovers, by age (2-kyr windows, human lects).**

\* scored on the big splits only (3 and 4 of them); counting all splits these bins give 0.69 and 0.82. The 9.0 reading rests on
bins of 6, 2 and 2 splits, so it would move by a kyr or two on another seed.

**Shares, three ways:** sisters parted <= 2 kyr: loose 0.541, strict (aligned distance under the threshold and recurring
correspondences) 0.462, true (same root in the etymologies) 0.572. Different families: loose 0.003, strict 0.000, true 0.0003.

**Intelligibility now** (`intelligibility.now`, 951 pairs):

Sisters parted under 2 kyr are only half intelligible (median 0.42); by 2-5 kyr
they do not. **Continua found by the pass: 2.** Family p269: human d177.2 – gnome d470.2 – gnome d765.1 (links 0.66, 0.56; ends
0.48), the west of Simath; family p300: halfling d543.3 – elf d550.2 – human d570.2 (0.53, 0.56; ends 0.36), the south of Ratal.
Both are shifted peoples speaking one family's lects. The viewer's in-browser search finds more chains at earlier frames.

("Rules per kyr" counts every change on the lect's line of descent over 20 kyr, wave-adopted ones included: dragons adopt 61% of
theirs, aarakocra 12%.)

- **Human:** the reference. One core word in ten survives 20 kyr, roughly what glottochronology would predict; sound change is fast.
- **Aarakocra: not mush in sound, amnesiac in words.** Their inventories are normal (39 segments, few labials, 12% ʔ-initial
  against 19% for humans), but at 23 changes per kyr and a 6-year generation 65% of living lects keep no proto core word at all,
  so no family is visible after a few kyr. Some lexicons do turn into ʔa-strings (d726 PERSON o˦ʔa˦o˦ʔa˦, TREE mi˦ʔa˦ʔa˦).
- **Elves: conservative, as wanted.** A third of the human rate and 46% of the core kept after 20 kyr.
- **Dragons: very conservative, perhaps too much.** 77% of the core kept, but the highest homophone share (14%) and most of their
  changes come from neighbours by wave. Almost never shift.
- **Kobolds: as fast as aarakocra** (20 changes per kyr, 12-year generation): families barely visible (median 1% core kept).
- **Dragonborn: human-like** in speed and retention; a quarter of their 97 lects arose by shifting to human or other rulers.

### DEFECTS

Measured over the 633 living lects (218,045 words):

- **Largest living inventories** (C + V): human d721, d843 and dragonborn d363 at 45 + 20 = 65; human d465 45 + 19; green dragon
  d91 45 + 17. d843: `ʔ m l h d̪ ŋ ɲ kʷʰ ɹ l̪ ɢʷ n̪ n qʷ t̪ tsʰ ɫ ɡʼ ʈʂʰ dʱ xʷ nʷ pʰ bʰ ʐ l̪ʷ ȵ ŋʷ ɡʰ bʱ ɬ d̪ʷ kʰ s kʼ ɮʷ t̪ʷ ɲʷ sʷ f ʂ z ɮ ɡʷʰ lʷ`
  + 20 vowels (8 nasal). d363 has ɓ and ɓ̥, n‼ and r‼, and 20 vowels with a‼ and i‼. PHOIBLE's upper quartile is 27 + 12.
- **Words over 12 segments:** 116 (0.05%); the longest are 16 segments, all CHILD (DESCENDANT) in elves and drow
  (d835 ʃi˦ɲi˨ʒi˦ŋʷi˨bʱi˦bʱi˦vi˨ɲi˨).
- **Brace segments `{`:** none (in words, inventories or grams). **Empty forms:** none in lexicons; 50 fused grams have a zero
  form (zero marking, acceptable).
- **Duplicate spellings:** in 513 of 633 lects two inventory segments get the same letter (ɜ and ə both ‹ë›, ɹ and ɾ both ‹r›,
  a, ä, ɐ all ‹a›); 546 pairs of different words share one spelling, in 217 lects.
- **Shifts per deme:** up to 6 (deme 168: hobgoblins of deme 289 rule it from 19 kyr, and it "shifts" at 19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 4).
  103 of the 214 shifts are a deme moving to another lect of the same true family, and the gap between a deme's shifts is
  never below, and has a median of, exactly 3.0 kyr: the cooldown sets the pace.
- **Koine levelling:** 237 entries. Example: d468.2 (halfling) THIS ɲɨ˧ʃi˧i˧, "borrowed from d844, koine levelling in city 1136".
- **Food routes:** 20 of 98 start at a taming site ("tamed here"), 22 "inherited by the donor", 56 "first known here". In 28% of
  hops the receiver's present word shows no borrowing (see rice in SAMPLES c2).
- **ʔ-initial words:** 15.6% of all words, 17.1% of core words (down from a third in the earlier run).
- **Top 12 segments (token share):** ʔ 6.9%, i˨ 4.4, ɨ˦ 4.2, ɨ˨ 3.7, i˦ 3.4, l 2.9, n 2.7, ɲ 2.7, m 2.5, ŋ 2.4, a˦ 2.2, ə˨ 2.2. ɨ is
  three of the top four vowels (i > ɨ "dispersion" fires everywhere); world languages favour a, i, u.
- **Tone everywhere:** 98% of living lects are tonal against 24% of protos and about 40% of real languages.
- **Same-step reversals:** in 1,315 lect-steps a change and its inverse fire together (n > ŋ and ŋ > n finally 656 times, s ~ z
  348, t ~ θ 220, d ~ ð 152).
- **Seen in the samples:** derivations with no sense behind them (EAT + 'thing' = 'tree', TREE + 'agent' = 'fire', WATER + 'agent'
  = 'river', SALT + 'agent' = 'sea', LOUSE + 'thing' = 'this', EAR + 'thing' = 'fish'); 39% of living core words go back to a
  coinage from nothing; I = WE in d774 and d280; homophonous grams (DAT = CAUS, 3PL = CLASS:2); dragonborn words as vowel strings;
  half the place names (169 of 343) are dated before the words they are built from were coined; one people uses the same
  exonym for different peoples 168 times (aarakocra call elves and dragonborn both Ehilanfï, 'the people of the east'); halflings
  and humans share the endonym I izh because the halflings' lect is a human one; proto forms such as *sret.ʃsukqʰi‼k* are still
  not possible words.

**Fix first, in order:**
1. **Tone and ɨ everywhere.** Tonogenesis and the i > ɨ push fire in almost every lect, so all species converge on the same
   tonal, ɨ-heavy sound. Make them conditional and rarer.
2. **Re-shifts on a 3-kyr clock.** Half the shifts are a deme re-adopting its rulers' family every 3.0 kyr; each one recopies the
   lexicon. A deme that already speaks the rulers' family should level (koine) rather than shift.
3. **Derivation semantics.** 'thing', 'agent' and 'like' produce absurd meanings and, in p306, a lɨ˨˦- prefix on 12% of words that
   fakes cognates. Restrict each affix to plausible source-target meaning pairs.
4. **Inventory growth and spelling.** Half the living lects end above PHOIBLE's upper quartile (to 65 segments), and 513 lects
   spell two segments alike; tie inventory growth to losses and give each contrast its own letter.
5. **Bookkeeping that contradicts itself:** food-route hops that splice different words, names dated before their words, a change
   and its inverse in one step, exonyms reused across peoples. Each is small, but a reader sees all of them.
